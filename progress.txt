So far, a lot has been accomplished. I have completed the parameterized light switch design for the 9g servo. I can now print a bracket that holds it in the right place do animations of it working correctly, and print a flipping mechanism that works. Unfortunately, it's too weak to actually flip a light switch, so I have to do all the 9g servo work over again with a newer, stronger servo, the MG996R, a 55g metal gear servo. Luckily, it shouldn't be too difficult with the parameterization work I have done. I just need to use my microscope, a caliper, and ImageJ (an image analysis tool) to identify the number and size of gear teeth for the new servo, take some new servo dimension measurements, tweak the servo mounting mechanism, and print the newly-designed parts. Note, on Sway, ImageJ needs the special "_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1" thing before it to work properly.
